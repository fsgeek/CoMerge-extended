Emerging systems with heterogeneous memory components demand new mechanisms and policies for spanning applications' data 
across the complex memory substrate. This is particularly important for data-intensive scientific or analytics applications, 
demanding both large memory capacity and fast access speeds, which can only be satisfied by embracing memory heterogeneity. 
Current approaches advocated in research are based on detailed full-application profiles, and while they show promise with respect 
to their effectiveness, their utility can be limited when considering multi-tenant environments, that need to support collocation and dynamic activity of different applications.
As a step toward extending the current state-of-the-art, we propose {\it CoMerge}, a memory-sharing rather than partitioning technique, that prioritizes allocations of performance-critical data 
across collocated applications, with respect to their overall sensitivity to changes in memory latency and bandwidth.
